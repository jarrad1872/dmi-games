# Core Drilling Research - For Game Authenticity

## Real-World Challenges (from Jarrad)

### Drilling Scenarios
- **Through walls** - horizontal drilling
- **Slab on deck** - drilling through floor slabs
- **Corrugated metal** - uneven surfaces, vibration issues
- **Overhead/upside down** - 5x difficulty, fighting gravity
- **Steel reinforcement (rebar)** - hitting rebar mid-cut, bit damage

### Major Pain Points
- **Water containment** - slurry management is critical
- **Catching cores** - cores falling can damage property or hurt people
- **Containment systems** - keeping the mess contained on job sites
- **Bit selection** - wrong bit = slow cuts, wasted money

### Game Mechanics to Incorporate
- [ ] Different drilling angles (horizontal, vertical, overhead)
- [ ] Rebar detection/avoidance
- [ ] Slurry/water management mini-game
- [ ] Core catching mechanic
- [ ] Surface type variety (concrete, corrugated, reinforced)
- [ ] Difficulty multipliers for overhead work
- [ ] Containment setup as prep phase

## Research TODO
- [ ] Watch core drilling tutorial videos
- [ ] Study common job site setups
- [ ] Learn about bit types and when to use each
- [ ] Understand water flow requirements
- [ ] Research vacuum/containment systems
- [ ] Look at common mistakes beginners make

## Why This Matters
Professionals will instantly recognize authentic details. Generic "drilling game" = forgettable. Game that captures real frustrations and satisfactions = shareable, memorable, builds brand trust.
